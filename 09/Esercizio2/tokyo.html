<p>Tokyo is the capital of Japan, located in the Kantō region on the island of Honshū.<br> 
Although it is often referred to as a city, according to the Japanese administrative order, <br>
it is a metropolis: today's Tokyo metropolitan area is the result of the merger of Tokyo <br>
Prefecture and its capital, Tokyo, in 1943. the merger of the two bodies was suppressed and, <br>
with the name Tōkyō, is today one of the forty-seven prefectures of Japan, as it is actually <br>
a large area on which several independent cities are located together in a single conurbation.<br>
 Because in fact the Japanese government and the emperor of Japan reside in the district of <br>
 Chiyoda, Tokyo is commonly referred to as the capital of the nation.</p>
